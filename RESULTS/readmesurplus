Results folder

This folder includes the probability matrices we obtained in the stability selection procedure; the first 38 were used to find the
stable 418 non-zero coefficients. The official gene symbols associated to the selected probe sets for spcovr as well as sgcca are 
included too, both as separate lists and merged in a single excel file (SPCovR_SPLS_Symbols_ABSWeights.xlsx). The merged list contains the 
absolute value of the weights, such that the sorted list singles out zero from non-zero coefficients. The part of the list relating to the 
non-zero weights on the second SPCovR component was copied together with the SGCCA weights in order to count the number of genes in the 
overlap. Annotation of the genes in the overlap and the genes belonging exclusively to the SPCovR component were performed with PANTHER.
Screen shots of the output resulting from annotating the gene lists (corresponding to the non-zero weights) with PANTHER and from performing 
an enrichment analysis on the loadings with PANTHER and GSEA, are organized in the pdf (Annotation sparse PCovR and sparse PLS with Panther and GSEA.pdf).
